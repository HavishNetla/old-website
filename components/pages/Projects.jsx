				TooLegalDidntRead is a transformative and groundbreaking app to solve
				the growing problem of long and complex legally binding documents by
				using NLP and keyword extraction to create a shortened version of a
				legal document that outlines your rights, as well as your legal
				limitations. This makes sure the company can not make you agree to
				anything you didnâ€™t want to agree to. The software also analyzes US
				Federal law, Case Law, and State law to find relevant law that applies
				to your terms of service

			The FIRST Tech Challenge is a highschool robotics competition where every
			season teams are tasked with building and programming a robot that
			competes in that years game, teams go through multiple levels of
			competition and particpate in judging. On my team, I was the Software
			Lead, driver of the robot, and a key part of Judging. After I graduated, I
			continue to give back to the community by volunteering at competitions.

				In SkyStone, the goal of the game is to deliver rectangular prism stones
				from a depot area into a foundation area. At the foundation the Robot
				must stack the stones as high as it can and at the end of the match the
				Robot must move the foundation out of the building area and place a
				special stone on the very top, to accomplish this we used dual cage ball
				bearing linear slides for our stacking system, and a dual side quad
				compliant wheel intake to intake the stones.

				This was my first year using Kotlin and Java simultaneously to program
				the robot. Additionally this year I utilized advanced odometry and path
				following techniques that allowed us to create one of the best
				autonomous programs in the state of Maryland and Virgina.

				In Relic Recovery, the goal was to score 4in by 4in cubes into a
				structure in certain patterns, at the very end of the match the robot
				must pick up a relic and extend it 5 feet outside of the field. To do
				this we created a dual chain lift that was able to score two cubes at
				the time, the limit according to the rules, and a linear slide extension
				for the relic. Using Java and advanced object oriented design we were
				able to control the dozens of DC Motors and sensors. By the end of the
				season we had the best autonomous in the World.

				I was in 7th grade when I started participating in the FIRST Tech
				Challenge RObotics Competition, and my first game was Velocity Vortex.
				The goal of Velocity Vortex was to shoot 3 inch wiffle balls 4 feet into
				the air, and into a "vortex" structure. To do this we created a dual
				flywheel system that utilized a perfectly shaped arc to launch the ball
				4 feet in the air. Using Java and an on board Android phone we control
				the dozens of DC Motors and sensors on the robot to do autonomous tasks
				and compete in the tele-op controlled period.
			</p>

			<p>
				My team had great success this year coming 2nd in both the Delaware
				State Championship, and Maryland Championship. After we went to the East
				Super Regionals were we were a semi-finalist and advanced to the World
				Championship in St. Louis. At the World Championship we went 8-1 in
				qualification matches and won our divison, and placed 2nd in the world.
