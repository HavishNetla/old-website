        TooLegalDidntRead is a transformative and groundbreaking app to solve
        the growing problem of long and complex legally binding documents by
        using NLP and keyword extraction to create a shortened version of a
        legal document that outlines your rights, as well as your legal
        limitations. This makes sure the company can not make you agree to
        anything you didnâ€™t want to agree to. The software also analyzes US
        Federal law, Case Law, and State law to find relevant law that applies
        to your terms of service
